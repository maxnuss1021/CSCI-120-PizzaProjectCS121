This project is a password grader which can be used to assess the strength of a password. 
It uses multiple different aspects of the password to produce the grade. 
It assesses each password based on length, special characters, numbers, and capital letters to determine a grade. 
It also compares the passwords to a list of the top 100k most popular passwords which I have linked below. In addition, the program uses tkinter for UI/UX purposes.
